## Goals

- First goal is to make sent mass emails.

## Features

- The core of the utility is exposed as a Webservice API (Django backend)
- **Performance** - Processing large FASTA files/DNA sequences are pretty fast as most of them utilize vectorized or parallelized 

## Requirements
- Python 3.10.0
- Django 4.1.2
- djangorestframework 3.14.0

## Installation
After you cloned the repository, you want to create a virtual environment, so you have a clean python installation.
You can do this by running the command
```
python -m venv env
```

After this, it is necessary to activate the virtual environment, you can get more information about this [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)

You can install all the required dependencies by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

after this setup `.env` file which helps to store credentials of project

```
cd mailman-web
```


```
touch .gitignore
```

## Contribution

As stated in the goals section, one of our primary goal is to provide a low barrier contributing opportunity to the bioinformatics open-source space. If you want to add more DNA sequencing/alignment/conversion algorithms, you can browse to `src -> core ->` and chose which part you want to extend. Every super module in the tree have the same structure, a `utils.rs` file which contain all functions, you can add a new function and implement it as an exposed actix-web endpoint in the `src -> api -> endpoints.rs` and that's it.
