## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from  `dev`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/BuildNShip/mailman-backend/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/BuildNShip/mailman-backend/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style for Python

- Follow the [PEP 8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python.

- Run `flake8` to ensure adherence to coding standards.
