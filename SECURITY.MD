## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project very seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability in our project, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability?

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please contact us at [security@email.com]. Provide as much information as possible about the vulnerability, including:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept
- Any other relevant information

We request that you not publicly disclose the issue until we have had a chance to investigate and address it.

### Response and Disclosure

Upon receiving a security report, our team will:

1. Confirm receipt of your report and start investigating the issue.
2. Work to promptly address the identified vulnerability.
3. Keep you informed about the progress towards a fix and full announcement.
4. Credit you for discovering the issue (unless you prefer to remain anonymous) when we publicly disclose the vulnerability.

We strive to keep our project as secure as possible, and we appreciate your help in keeping our user community safe.
